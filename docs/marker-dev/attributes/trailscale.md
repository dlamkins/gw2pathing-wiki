## Description

*Allows you to apply a width modifier to a trail.*

| Attribute | Data Type | Example | Default Value | Description |
|-|-|-|-|-|
| trailscale | [float](../datatypes/float) | `trailscale="1.5"` | 1 | The width multiplier to apply to the width of the trail. |

## Remarks

By default, trails are 1.016 meters (40 inches) wide.  This value is multiplied by your trailscale multiplier, so a trailscale of 1.5 would result in a trail that is 60 inches wide.
