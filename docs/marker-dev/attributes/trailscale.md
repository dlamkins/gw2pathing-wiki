## Description
Allows you to apply a width modifier to a trail.
| Attribute | Data Type | Default Value | Example | Description |
|-|-|-|-|-|
| trailScale | float | 1 | 1.5 | The width multiplier to apply to the width of the trail. | 

## Remarks

By default, trails are 1.016 meters (40 inches) wide.  This value is multiplied by your trailscale multiplier, so a trailscale of 1.5 would result in a trail that is 60 inches wide.
