## Description
Allows you to set a value to the users clipboard. Good for providing waypoints, build templates, and more.
| Attribute | Data Type | Default Value | Example | Description |
|-|-|-|-|-|
| copy | string |  | [&BOAHAAA=] | The text assigned to the clipboard. | 
| copy-message | string |  | Jacka Itzel waypoint copied! | The message shown on screen when the copy is activated. | 

## Triggering a copy

When interacted with (typically the F key), a marker with the `copy` attribute will activate.

When applied to a [separator category](isseparator), clicking on the separator will activate the copy and display the copy message.

## User Configuration

Users may limit what automatic behaviors they consent to.  Regarding the copy attribute, users can select one of three behavior consent levels.

| Allow markers to set clipboard... | Description |
|-|-|
| Always (Default) | Markers can set the clipboard automatically when in range or when interacted without limitation. |
| Only When Interacted With | Copy auto trigger is disabled.  The copy attribute will only be activated when manually interacted with by the player. |
| Never | Markers will be entirely unable to set the clipboard. |
