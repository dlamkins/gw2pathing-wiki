## Triggering

Behaviors activate when they are triggered.  Triggering a marker can be done by pressing the action key while in-range of the marker or by walking within the [TriggerRange](/docs/marker-dev/attributes/triggerrange) if [AutoTrigger](/docs/marker-dev/attributes/autotrigger) is enabled.

## Keeping states

Behavior states are tracked by a [GUID](/docs/marker-dev/attributes/guid).  Between launches, this information is saved to disk.

| Overlay | File |
|-|-|
| Blish HUD | Stored in `\Documents\Guild Wars 2\addons\blishhud\markers\data\states\timers.txt` as `guid,timestamp` pairs. |
| TacO | Stored in `activationdata.xml` as XML |
