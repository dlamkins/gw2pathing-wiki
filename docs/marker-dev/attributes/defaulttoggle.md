| Attribute | Data Type | Example | Default Value | Description |
|-|-|-|-|-|
| defaulttoggle | [bool](../datatypes/bool) | `defaulttoggle="0"` | 1 | If the category should be toggled on or off by default. |

:::tip

This attribute, when set to `0`, is a great way to help keep your pack as unobtrusive as possible for your users by disabling niche categories by default.  Users can always toggle these categories back on themselves as needed and their preferences will remain saved.
