For the best experience, marker packs are shared as archives so that they can be shared as a single file and kept smaller.

### Supported formats

#### .zip

This ZIP contains all marker XML files as well as other resources (such as trl, textures, etc).  All file paths within the marker pack will be evaluated relative to the root of the ZIP archive.

#### .taco

This is a .zip file with the extension changed to .taco to dissuade users from extracting them.  They are functionally the same.
