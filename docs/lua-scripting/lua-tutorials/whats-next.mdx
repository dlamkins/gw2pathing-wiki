That's it for now! With this you hopefully have a decent base to start tinkering around with scripts on your own.

Hopefully these tutorials were helpful in one way or another. 

If you have any questions or need help with your own scripts, feel free to ask in the [BHUD Discord](https://discord.gg/FYKN3qh), we're always happy to help!

Also feel free to check out scripts other people have made to see how they work. You can find my scripts on the [TehsTrails GitHub](https://github.com/xrandox/TehsTrails/tree/main/TehsTrails/Data/TehsTrails/Scripts) if you need some inspiration.
