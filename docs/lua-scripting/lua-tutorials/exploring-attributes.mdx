Let's start by exploring how we can use [script attributes](/docs/lua-scripting/lua-lib/api_intro#script-attributes) to execute our scripts. I'd recommend reading through the linked section in the Pathing API for an overview and then coming back.

We'll start by creating a simple script that prints a message to the console when the player triggers one of our markers, similar to the example on the overview page.

For this, we'll be using the [`script-trigger`](/docs/lua-scripting/lua-script-attr/script-trigger) attribute. Feel free to open that in a new window for reference.

That particular attribute has two default parameters, `marker` and `isAutoTrigger`. For now, we'll just focus on using the `isAutoTrigger` parameter. 

Let's start by creating a new function to use with `script-trigger`. 

:::tip
It's recommended to prefix your global functions with a unique identifier to avoid conflicts with other scripts that might use similar naming schemes.
:::

Let's create a new script in your `/Scripts` folder named `TriggerFunction.lua` and add a require for it in your `pack.lua`, like so:
```lua title="pack.lua"
Example = {}

-- Add a require for our new script
Pack:Require("/Data/ExamplePack/Scripts/TriggerFunction.lua")
```

Now, let's add a simple function to `TriggerFunction.lua` that prints a message to the console when it's called.

```lua title="/Data/ExamplePack/Scripts/TriggerFunction.lua"
-- Notice that we're using the `marker` and `isAutoTrigger` parameters here, followed by our own parameter `customInput`.
function EP_TriggerFunction(marker, isAutoTrigger, customInput)
    -- Here we use the `isAutoTrigger` parameter to determine if the trigger was automatic or manual.
    if isAutoTrigger then
        print("Auto trigger activated! Custom input: " .. customInput)
    else
        print("Manual trigger activated! Custom input: " .. customInput)
    end
end
```

The last piece of the puzzle is to add the `script-trigger` attribute to one (or several) of our markers.

```xml title="ExamplePack.xml"
<POI ... script-trigger="EP_TriggerFunction(1)">
<POI ... script-trigger="EP_TriggerFunction(2)" triggerRange="20" autoTrigger="1">
```

Now, we can go in-game and test our new function. When you go up and manually trigger the first marker, you should see the message "Manual trigger activated! Custom input: 1" in the console. When you get close to the second marker, you should see the message "Auto trigger activated! Custom input: 2" in the console.

That's all it takes to use a script attribute! There are 5 script-attributes that you can use in a similar fashion to this, you can find more information about them in the [Pathing API Docs](/docs/lua-scripting/lua-lib/api_intro#script-attributes).
