## The Module

To provide marker pack support, Blish HUD can use the "Pathing" module.  The Pathing module supports using TacO style marker packs (as .taco or .zip files) in Blish HUD!

To install the Pathing module, find the **Pathing** module within the Module Repo and install it (see: [Installing modules](https://blishhud.com/docs/user/installing-modules)).

## Marker Packs

:::caution Watch out!

**Don't extract the marker packs!**  They're intended to be left inside of their `.zip` or `.taco` archives.  If you extract them, Pathing can have difficulties loading your marker textures and trails.

Likewise, packs which come as XML files may not work with Pathing as expected.  If you have any questions about using a marker pack not found in our repo, please reach out to us on [Discord](https://link.blishhud.com/discord) for assistance with repacking.

### From Repo

Within Pathing is now a marker pack repo.  Popular marker packs can be downloaded from the repo and kept automatically up to date.
