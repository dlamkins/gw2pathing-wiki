This text-and-picture guide is also on the [Metal's Marker-mancy Discord](https://discord.gg/FP8dQj6KBj).

All information here is an example of how I mark for "Only Fish", YMMV

## Tools of the Trade
- TacO (for now, for dropping the markers themselves)
- Blish HUD
  - Pathing Module
  - Distance Rings Module
- VSCode, N++, or some other robust text editor that can parse .xml files and (ideally) help ensure you have quotes and brackets synced up
- Excel or equivalent
- a Github account or other way to host your pack for update and download
